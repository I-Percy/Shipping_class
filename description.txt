A shipping container management system. 

The shipyard consists of containers, each heading to a certain destination. 
Each container contains packages and each package has an owner, destination, 
weight, and a unique id tag. 
Each time a shipping item is placed in a container that is going to their 
destination, it must be placed so the lightest items are at the top of the 
container. Shipping containers require unique id numbers, have a capacity of 
2000 lbs, and have a destination once any goods are placed in them.
Shipping containers should be sorted so that the destinations are in 
alphabetical order, for easier train loading.
